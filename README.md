###Product description

Here is the data product for the course project of the data product class on Coursera

This data product extract the data from the mtcars database, and enable you to create plots from this data table. 

A good example is to put in X var "am", in Y var "mpg", and to select a boxplot. You will get the graph used in the regression course project from the Coursera class in the Mooc Data Science specialisation created by the John Hopkins University.

The tab navigation bar enables you to :
- create plots
- read the summary of the data table
- access to the data table
